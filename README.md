# Advent of Code 2018

**SPOILER WARNING: This repository contains the solutions!**

This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code 2018 challenge.

All solutions are written in Rust nightly. Although Rust might not be the most
elegant language to complete these solutions in (Python or even C might be
easier), I'm interested in learning Rust so I felt that this was a good way to
learn it.

## Instructions

To build this repository ensure that the latest Rust nightly version is
installed. Then execute the following commands in the command line prompt:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Jsvcycling/advent-of-code-2018.git
$ cd advent-of-code-2018
$ cargo build
```

All the projects will be built. Now, in order to execute them, execute the
following command:

```bash
$ cargo run --bin <name>
```

Where `<name>` is the selected day (e.g., `day-01`, `day-02`, and so on).

To execute the code on a different input data, replace the appropriate file in the `input/` directory with the new file.
