# Advent of Code 2018

This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code 2018 challenge.

All solutions are written in Rust nightly. Although Rust might not be the most
elegant language to complete these solutions in (Python or even C might be
easier), I'm interested in learning Rust so I felt that this was a good way to
learn it.
